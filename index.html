            January 20, 2018: 
            My name is Anna. I decided to start this blog to help girls and teenagers grow more and more in the grace God has given to them. It can be hard growing up surrounded by so many people; you can get lost in the crowd. My hope is that, girls around the globe will decide to grow in His grace that we were all blessed with and be an encouragement to others around her.
